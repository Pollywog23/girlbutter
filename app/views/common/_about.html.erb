        <p class="lead">I started programming in 2015.  I was working as a Medical Assistant and came across an opportunity to learn coding skills so I jumped on it. I have had the <strong>best</strong> teacher though out my learning prosses and learned more than I imagined! I now, love what I do. </p>
